We are a team aspiring to flip the script at the hackathon by offering teams the ability to issue an ERC20 token that represents the pool of their prize winnings (from sponsors prizes and others). These ERC20 tokens can then be distributed as bounty rewards or as a tool for speculation. Additionally, we will be building a stack of applications like a swiss army knife, helping hackers speed up their work with custom built tools based on feedback.

@Wedergarten Full stack developer - head

@icetoad.eth Community manager, onboarder public relations
